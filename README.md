## 🌟 Project Overview

Our cutting-edge autonomous rover is built to navigate various terrains with:

- **Obstacle and pothole detection**
- **Real-time GPS tracking**
- **Autonomous decision-making capabilities**

The rover aims not just to move from point A to B, but to do so **safely, efficiently, and independently**.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **🧠 Advanced Sensory Navigation**: Detects and avoids obstacles and potholes in real time.
- **📍 Precision GPS Tracking**: Continuously updates its coordinates to ensure accurate route monitoring.
- **🤖 Autonomous Flexibility**: Can reach predefined destinations without any predefined paths.

---

## 💡 Problem Solved

Traditional navigation rovers often require fixed paths. Our rover autonomously adapts to the terrain and avoids unknown obstacles—perfect for environments that change often or are unpredictable.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

We use cost-effective GPS, which works well on Earth. For space applications, **IMUs** or **Star Trackers** would be more suitable.

---

## 💰 Budget

- **Total Cost**: INR 3000  
- We kept costs low by using locally available components while ensuring strong performance.

---

## 🔮 Future Applications

- Terrain exploration and surveying
- Search and rescue missions
- Agricultural field mapping
- Space robotics (with further upgrades)
